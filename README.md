**regularity** is a friendly regular expression builder
for [Node](https://nodejs.org).
It is a JavaScript port
of the very fine [`regularity` Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/regularity).


Regular expressions are a powerful way
of matching patterns against text,
but too often they are _write once, read never_.
After all, who wants to try and decipher

```javascript
/^(?:[0-9]){3}-(?:[A-Za-z]){2}(?:#)?(?:a|b)(?:a){2,4}\$$/i
```

when you could express it as

```javascript
  var Regularity = require('regularity');
  var regularity = new Regularity();

  var myRegexp = regularity
      .startWith(3, 'digits')
      .then('-')
      .then(2, 'letters')
      .maybe('#')
      .oneOf('a', 'b')
      .between([2, 4], 'a')
      .endWith('$')
      .insensitive()
      .done();
```

While taking up a bit more space,
regular expressions created using **regularity**
are much more readable than their cryptic counterparts.
But they are still native regular expressions!



## Installation

To get **regularity**,
you need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
It should have been installed
along with [Node](https://nodejs.org).
Once you have it, just run

```
$ npm install regularity
```

in your terminal,
and it should promptly download
into the current folder.



## Usage

When you [require](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_modules) **regularity**,
all you get is a constructor function.
To start building a regular expression,
you should instantiate an object using `new`,
as demonstrated above,
and then call
any of the methods it provides
with the proper arguments.

When you are done building the regular expression,
tell **regularity** so by calling [`done`](#done).
This call will return a native [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
implementing the pattern which you described
using the methods of the **regularity** object,
which you can then use
for your own purposes.

Notice that you should probably use
one new **regularity** instance
for each regular expression
that you want to build.
If you keep calling methods
on an existing **regularity** instance,
you will be reusing
the declarations you made on that object before.



## Documentation

**regularity** instances expose a set of methods
(the _[DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) methods_)
which allow you to declaratively build
the regular expression you want.
They all return `this`,
so they are chainable.
Notice that the order in which you call these methods
determines the order in which the pattern is assembled.

All _DSL methods_ accept at least
one of the following signatures:
either an _unnumbered constraint_,
which is expected to be a single string,
such as `then('xyz')`,
or a _numbered constraint_,
composed by a count and a pattern,
such as `atLeast(2, 'ab')`.

In addition, the following _special identifers_
are supported as a shorthand
for some common patterns:

```javascript
'digit'        : '[0-9]'
'lowercase'    : '[a-z]'
'uppercase'    : '[A-Z]'
'letter'       : '[A-Za-z]'
'alphanumeric' : '[A-Za-z0-9]'
'whitespace'   : '\s'
'space'        : ' '
'tab'          : '\t'
```

_Special identifiers_ may be pluralized,
and **regularity** will still understand them.
This allows you
to write more meaningful declarations,
because `then(2, 'letters')` works
in addition to `then(1, 'letter')`.


The following is a more detailed explanation
of all the _DSL methods_ and their signatures.
Should you have any doubts,
please refer to the [spec](./spec/regularity_spec.js),
where you can find examples
of all the supported use cases.

Bear in mind that, in what follows,
`pattern` stands for any string,
which migt or might not be
any of the _special identifiers_,
and which might include characters
which need escaping (you don't need
to escape them yourself, as **regularity**
will take care of that),
and `n` stands for any positive integer
(that is, any integer
greater than or equal to `1`).
Where `n` is optional
(denoted by `[n,]` in the signature),
passing `1` as `n`
is equivalent to not passing `n` at all.

- <a name="startWith">[**`startWith([n,] pattern)`**](#startWith)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  exactly `n` times
  at the beginning of the input.
  This method may be called only once.

- <a name="append">[**`append([n,] pattern)`**](#append)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  exactly `n` times
  after what has been declared so far
  and before anything that is declared afterwards.

- <a name="then">[**`then([n,] pattern)`**](#then)</a>:
  This is just an alias for [**`append`**](#append).

- <a name="endWith">[**`endWith([n,] pattern)`**](#endWith)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  exactly `n` times
  at the end of the input.
  This method may be called only once.


- <a name="maybe">[**`maybe(pattern)`**](#maybe)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  either one or zero times.

- <a name="oneOf">[**`oneOf(firstPattern[, secondPattern[, ...]])`**](#oneOf)</a>:
  Require that at least
  one of the passed `pattern`s occur.

- <a name="between">[**`between(range, pattern)`**](#between)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  a number of consecutive times
  between `range[0]` and `range[1]`, both included.
  `range` is expected to be an array
  containing two positive integers.

- <a name="zeroOrMore">[**`zeroOrMore(pattern)`**](#zeroOrMore)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  any number of consecutive times,
  including zero times.

- <a name="oneOrMore">[**`oneOrMore(pattern)`**](#oneOrMore)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  consecutively at least once.

- <a name="atLeast">[**`atLeast(n, pattern)`**](#atLeast)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  consecutively at least `n` times.
  Typically, here `n` should be greater than `1`
  (if you want it to be exactly `1`, you should use [**`oneOrMore`**](#oneOrMore)).

- <a name="atMost">[**`atMost(n, pattern)`**](#atMost)</a>:
  Require that `pattern` occur
  consecutively at most `n` times.
  Typically, here `n` should be greater than `1`
  (if you want it to be exactly `1`, you should use [**`maybe`**](#maybe)).



Besides the _DSL methods_, **regularity** instances
also expose the following methods:

- <a name="insensitive">[**`insensitive()`**](#insensitive)</a>:
  Specify that the regular expression
  mustn't distinguish
  between uppercacase and lowercase letters.

- <a name="global">[**`global()`**](#global)</a>:
  Specify that the regular expression
  must match against all possible matches in the string
  (instead of matching just the first,
  which is the default behaviour).

- <a name="multiline">[**`mulltiLine()`**](#multiline)</a>:
  Specify that the input
  may span multiple lines.

- <a name="done">[**`done()`**](#done)</a>:
  Return the native [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) object
  representing the pattern which you described
  by means of the previous calls
  on that **regularity** instance.

- <a name="regexp">[**`regexp()`**](#regexp)</a>:
  This is just an alias for [**`done`**](#done).
